title: What's your target?

---

In this note I'd like to draw attention to a deceptively simple but tragically oft-overlooked issue in data analysis: 
what is your target? In other words, what question are you trying to answer? 

An example that comes to mind is the controversy surrounding the USC/LA Times [tracking poll](http://graphics.latimes.com/usc-presidential-poll-dashboard/) of prospective voters' voting intentions in the run up to the 2016 US presidential elections.

The poll attracted attention for what seemed, relative to other polls, to be a bias in favor of Donald Trump. 

Nate Cohn of the New York Times [investigated](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/13/upshot/how-one-19-year-old-illinois-man-is-distorting-national-polling-averages.html), and found that due to the unique methodology of the poll, its results were highly sensitive
to the intentions of one very highly weighted individual. 

The heavy weight assigned to this individual was due to a decision that the poll's creators had made with respect to a bias/variance tradeoff:
in order to reduce bias, the respondents would be binned according to demographic characteristics.
In doing so, they introduced a higher variance. 

On the day of the election, November 8, 2016, the USC/LA Times poll showed Trump leading Clinton by 3.2 points, 46.8% to 43.6%,
while many other national polls of voter sentiment showed Clinton ahead. By the late evening, of course, it was clear that Trump had won,
and an article modestly titled [The USC/L.A. Times poll saw what other surveys missed: A wave of Trump support](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-usc-latimes-poll-20161108-story.html)
was posted to latimes.com .

The blithe reporting in the hours after the election was, however, mistaken. While Trump did indeed win the election, he also, due to an idiosyncrasy in the American political system,
lost the popular vote, which national polls purport to predict. 

In fact, Clinton won the popular vote in the end, by 2.1 points, 48.2% to 46.1%. While many national polls had predicted outcomes close to this,
the USC/LA Times poll was not among them, having missed the popular vote outcome by 5.3 points in total. 

Several months later, the LA Times did publish a somewhat [muddled consession](https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-latimes-poll-20170224-story.html).
