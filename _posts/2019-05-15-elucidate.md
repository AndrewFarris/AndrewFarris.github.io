title: How not to analyze data: abusing transformations

We're used to applying data transformations in analysis, whether it be a simple logarithmic rescaling applied to univeriate data or sophisticated preprocessing applied to complex, high-dimentional data. It is essential that we do so judiciously, without introducing bias in the process.

Least we think that bad statistics is new under the sun, let's hand the mic to a sarcastic [Babbage (1830)](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1216/1216-h/1216-h.htm):

"Another approved receipt, when the observations to be used will not come within the limit of accuracy, which it has been resolved they shall possess, is to calculate them by two different formulae. The difference in the constants employed in those formulae has sometimes a most happy effect in promoting unanimity amongst discordant measures. If still greater accuracy is required, three or more formulae can be used."
